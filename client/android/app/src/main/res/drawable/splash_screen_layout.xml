    <!-- Centered Logo (Assuming we use the app icon, but let's use a vector wrapper or just the icon bitmap) -->
    <!-- For simplicity, let's use the mipmap icon which is circular by default in many adaptive setups, 
         or we can define a shape. User wants "Circular logo, no background". 
         Actually, we can't animate the window background drawable directly like "rotate". 
         Window backgrounds are static.
         
         To achieve "rotate and expand", we need a custom Splash Activity or Layout.
         However, Capacitor uses a Splash Screen plugin or Theme.
         
         If we change the Theme background, it's static.
         
         The user wants: "Round logo, no background (transparent?), gradually rotate and expand".
         
         Capacitor Splash Screen API (v4+) uses Android 12 Splash Screen API on newer devices, 
         which supports an icon animation.
         
         For older devices (or standard Capacitor compat), it shows a static drawable.
         
         If we want a complex animation (Rotate + Expand), we usually need:
         1. A dedicated SplashActivity.
         2. An AnimatedVectorDrawable (AVD) for the icon (Android 12+ style).
         
         Let's try to set up an Animated Vector Drawable approach which works well with the new SplashScreen API.
         
         But first, let's look at `styles.xml`. It uses `Theme.SplashScreen` which is the androidx compat library.
         
         I will modify `themes.xml` (or `styles.xml`) to use an animated icon.
         
         Step 1: Create a simple circular logo vector (if not exists).
         Step 2: Create an animated-vector that rotates and scales it.
         Step 3: Apply it to `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`.
         
         Let's check if we have a vector logo. `ic_launcher_background.xml` exists.
         We probably have `ic_launcher_foreground.xml`.
